\subsection{Visualization and User Interface}

Graph visualization in \asplain\ is implemented using \clingraph~\cite{hasascst24a},
which allows visual representations to be defined declaratively in ASP.
All images presented in this paper are generated automatically by the system
using \clingraph.
The corresponding visualization encodings are available in the system repository.

In addition, \asplain\ provides a user interface built on top of \clinguin~\cite{behasc24a}.
The interface allows users to interactively explore the contrastive explanations
generated by our approach.
Users can iterate through models of a program,
pose queries,
and visualize the foils that explain differences
between reference and foil models.
For visualization, we use the \clingraph\ extension of \clinguin,
which enables the display of SVG images generated by \clingraph
directly within the web interface.
Figure~\ref{fig:ui_sequence} shows a series of UI screenshots
for the process to obtain the explaination in from Figure~\ref{fig:contrastive_graph}.
The interface also supports the generation of natural language explanations,
helping users understand the changes applied to the program.
