\subsection{Visualization and User Interface}

\begin{itemize}
    \item To visualize the graphs we use \clingraph~\cite{hasascst24a}.
    \item \Clingraph\ allows us to create visual representations defined in ASP.
    \item The images in this paper were created automatically by the system using clingraph.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
    \item We provide a user interface using \clinguin~\cite{behasc24a}
    \item This allows users to interactively explore the contrastive explanations generated by our approach.
    \item Users can explore models of the program, add queries interactively, and visualize the foils that explain the differences between the reference and foil models.
    \item Natural language explanations can also be generated to help users understand the changes made to the program.
    \item We use the \clingraph\ extension which allows visualization of svg images generated by clingraph in the web interface.
\end{itemize}
