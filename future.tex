\section{Future work}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Extend the approach to handle more complex ASP constructs, such as aggregates and optimization statements.
    For this we could give meaning to the different auxiliary atoms
    or consider a more complex normal form that can for instance handle bounds in the choice rules.
    \item Consider \textit{\#sum} aggregates via weighted edges in the program graph.
    %
    \item Can we write a subset minimal preference on the additions/removals? (related to UNSAT CORE)?
    We could aso use asprin to define more complex preferences.
\end{itemize}
