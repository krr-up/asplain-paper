\def\asplain{ASPLAIN}


The present paper is related closely related to work in the research on xAI in ASP or Prolog such as the xASP systems \cite{ly:iclp,ly:spie,trieu2022xasp,alviano2024xai} and the systen  
s(CASP) \cite{AriasCCG20}. Since xASP2 is a signficant enhancement of its predecesssors described in \cite{ly:iclp,ly:spie,trieu2022xasp}, we will discuss the relationship of \asplain{} with xASP2 and s(CASP). 
Both xASP2 and s(CASP) compute a trace of the computation of a query given an answer set, thereby providing explanations for atoms in an answer set (true atoms) and atoms not in an answer set (false atoms).
